[00:00.74]Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said his country won’t give its land to occupiers and that any solution without Ukraine’s participation would be against peace.
[00:13.49]His comments follow US President Donald Trump’s announcement that he will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on 15 August to discuss the war.
[00:25.44]Trump suggested the talks could involve territory swaps, an idea Ukraine rejects under its constitution.
[00:34.61]Putin insists any peace deal must allow Russia to keep four occupied regions, while Zelensky wants an unconditional ceasefire as a starting point for negotiations.
[00:47.02]Ukrainian officials warn that talks without Kyiv risk concessions they cannot accept and that rewarding aggression would harm international law.
[00:57.22]European leaders are concerned about the talks, fearing that Putin aims to reduce sanctions rather than end the war.
[01:06.36]Ukraine believes the US can help more, but only in ways that respect Ukraine’s security, sovereignty, and constitutional limits.
