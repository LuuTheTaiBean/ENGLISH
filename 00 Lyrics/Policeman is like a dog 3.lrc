[00:00.86]Police Constable Hutton and hit team from England were involved in a high-speed chase when they used stinger devices to bring the car to a stop.
[00:11.08]The four young people in the vehicle started to run away, but quick thinking and one unusual tactic stopped one man from getting away.
[00:21.20]The PC was able to bark so realistically that everyone around thought that he had a trained canine with him.
[00:29.21]The policeman has been the subject of a fair few jokes since the incident, but who cares if people think that you are barking mad if it means that you get your man?
