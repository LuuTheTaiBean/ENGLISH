[00:04.70]<b>Fred: </b>Yes. What are you going to do first?
[00:07.80]<b>Tom: </b>Hmm... first, I'm going to rent a big car, meet my girlfriend and take her to an expensive restaurant. We're going to have steak and drink champagne. What about you, Fred?

[00:29.50]<b>Tom: </b>Really? You're not going to work for your mother-in-law!
[00:32.80]<b>Fred: </b>Yes. She's got a little caf√© in London.
